Entries in the gutter servers expire quickly, instead of been told to be deleted by the frontend server. If the writing frontend client has to delete the entries in the gutter server directly, this meams that every write has to go not only to the one specific memcache, but also all the gutter servers, which only accounts for 1% of the total memcache server in a cluster. Then for every write, it has much more work to do but end up doing nothing, but for the gutter servers, it might also be overloaded.
